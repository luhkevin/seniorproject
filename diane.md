=====================
* What/Why probabalistic? Maybe a title change?
    * Autoassociative memory
    * More on fidelity
    * Can't completely dissociate from probabilistic

* Introduction needs to be more about what we're doing instead of just background
* Explaining machine learning -- should be fixed once our project idea is more fixed and less about probablistic associative mem.
* Move things from System Implementation to System Model
* How does probabilistic memory relate to ML?
* ML techniques implementation?
