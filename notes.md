Similarity query
================
-Ditch probability 
-Query memory, should return same value every time
    -based on highest probability, based on some probability we use
-Clarify mapping

User input features/lamdas

Have an interface to provide an easy, unified way to give the user a method to 
map values. Various probabilistic models to implement this interface. Models can be used to implement 

Provide a way for user to store values, query 

Given a set of raw data, easy for user to provide 



Abstract
========
- Mention regular memory (briefly), regular associative memory (AM), probabilistic associative memory (refer to zdancewicz's) 
- Mention the benefits of this mentions (programming model for using PAM)

Introduction
============
- Define core terminology
- Basically elaborate more on AM and PAM
- Consequences/Benefits 

Related Work
============
- non-holographic paper and some other ones...
- What people actually use when it comes to storing stuff with less space

Project Proposal
================
***Anticipated Approach*** 
- Overview of methods/processes
- Block-flow diagram 

***Technical Challenges*** 
- Stuff specified in Zdancewicz's paper 
- Limitations, how do we deal with certain constraints

***Evaluation Criteria*** 
- Writing an application for the library


Timeline
========


Introduction
============
-Define probabilistic
-Associative memory -- what it's normally used for
-Our library makes it easier to do these applications, 

Project Proposal
================
-Make clear what we're doing: creating a language that makes it easier to do what normal prob. assoc. memories do. 
-Easier to do a wide variety of applications

Anticipated Approach
====================
