- Consequences/Benefits 

Related Work
============
- non-holographic paper and some other ones...
- What people actually use when it comes to storing stuff with less space

Project Proposal
================
***Anticipated Approach*** 
- Overview of methods/processes
- Block-flow diagram 

***Technical Challenges***
